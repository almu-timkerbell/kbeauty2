        <p class="primerP">I'm Almu. I hope this little details about me will help you to know me and my blog betterðŸ˜€
              </p>
            <p>I am 30 years old. I used to have oily acne-prone skin. Now, I'm on the dry side, with large pores in the central area of my face. 
            But if there's a word that describes my skin, is SENSITIVE.</p>

           <p>Like a lot of other people, I found out about k-beauty through k-pop(shawol here).
            Once I tried (my very first product was the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream), I never looked back.
            Something about the texture, the price, the quality... Everything was just perfect. </p> 

            <p>When I was a teenager, I suffer from acne, specially in my cheecks and my jaw line. 
                For a while, it was like people had no other topic of conversation with me ("had you seen you face?", 
                "what are you doing for takin care of it?", "have you seen a doctor?", "have you tried this or that product/method?").
                And of course, I tried everything I could. I went to the doctor, and it helped a bit, but it didn't 
                solve the problem completly. For years, I washed my face more than I should and with products that stripped 
                my skin very badly. My main problem was papules over my jaw line and very deep blackheats around my cheeck area.
                I tried almost everything I could find and people told me: exfoliating with lemon and sugar,
                lederpax (a pads with citric acid, purified water, ethanol and propylene glycol that dried 
                the skin  and stung like crazy), apple cider vinegar, cut-out on sugars, exercise...
                But nothing seemed to heal my skin. 
                During that time, had periods of better and worse skin. Better during summer, which, for someone who 
                was told it has an oily skin, didnt make much sense. In winter, all my face would turn reddish and would 
                break out more often. Still, I didnt know how to change completly. How to make my pores to look smaller, 
                to make my complexion more shinee and fresh looking. Less red and more ....
                Then, I left my country for United Kingdom. The changes (enviromental, emotional...) affected my
                skin A LOT. Again, I saw myself suffering from papules, on top of the scars that had formed from my past 
                

            </p>
            <p>My dream is to go to Korea to experience the food, the culture and, of course, to buy all the products
                my wallet can handle!
