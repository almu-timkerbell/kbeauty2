         <h2> About me</h2>
        <p class="primerP">I'm Almu. I hope this little details about me will help you to know me and my blog betterðŸ˜€
        </p>
        <p>I am 30 years old. I used to have oily acne-prone skin. Now, I'm on the dry side, with large pores in the central area of my face. 
            But if there's a word that describes my skin, is SENSITIVEðŸ†˜ðŸ†˜ðŸ†˜.</p>


            <p class="history" >The story of my skin</p>

            <p>When I was a teenager, I suffered from acne, specially in my cheecks and my jaw line. 
                For a while, it was like people had no other topic of conversation with me ("had you seen your face?", 
                "what are you doing to take care of it?", "have you seen a doctor?", "have you tried this or that product/method?").
                And of course, I tried everything I could. I went to the doctor, and it helped a bit, but it didn't 
                solve the problem completly. For years, I washed my face more than what I should and with products that stripped 
                my skin barrier very badly. My main problem was papules over my jaw line and very deep blackheats around my cheeck area.
                I tried almost everything I could find and people told me: exfoliating with lemon and sugar,
                lederpax (a pads with citric acid, purified water, ethanol and propylene glycol that dried 
                the skin  and stung like crazy), apple cider vinegar, cut-out on sugars, exercise...
                But nothing seemed to heal my skin. <br>
                During that time, my skin had better and worste periods. Better during summer, which, for someone who 
                was told it has an oily skin, didnt make much sense. In winter, all my face would turn reddish and would 
                break out more often.  I was obsesed on how to make my pores to look smaller, 
                to make my complexion more shinee and fresh looking, less red and more bright. <br>
                Then, I left my country for United Kingdom. The changes (enviromental, emotional...) affected my
                skin A LOT. Again, I saw myself suffering from papules, on top of the scars I already had from my past troubles.
                This time, I took it with a little more of rationality(at least, for a while). I only used brands with clean ingredients, 
                 which I found milder for my sensitive skin. Still, I exfoliated way too much. It was around this time that 
                 I discovered the power of retinol. I got a 0.05% cream from Ebay for like Â£15 and started to use it every single day.
                 Needless to say, my skin started to peel. It felt itchy, uncomfortable and looked horrible. But I
                 started seeing a new skin revealing underneath, so I refused to use it less or stop for good. For the first time, I was 
                 seeing results quickly, and for me that was the only thing that mattered. I still get 
                 shivers thinking how much I hurt my skin at that time. God, I didn't even use sunscreen(I know, I know, I want to
                 kill myself too!). Luckilly, it didn't last a lot of time. <br>
                 To be honest, after that experience, I went throught a period of time where I didnt care about anything.
                 I was depressed and I could not be bother to clean my skin. I still bought products here and there, but I didnt
                 take it very seriosly. And let me tell you something: the "caveman" method, did not work for me. My skin
                 still needed hydration, balance and calmness. And shortly after I discovered Korean Skincare. 
                
              </p>

              <p class="whyKOB">Why Korean Skincare? </p>

              <p>So, if you have read till here, you've realised that my skin regime has not always been the best. But TBH, I 
                  never found that very thing that made a real big change, or that was even in accordance with my life-style. 
                  Nothing from the western market really excited me. <br>

                  Like a lot of other people, I found out about k-beauty through k-pop(shawol here).
                  At first, I didnt understand the whole fuss about it. At the end of the day, they were "only creams". But the 
                  more I heard about it, the more it intrigued me. I started watching more and more videos about this "new" (at least for me)
                  method that claimed that with 10 steps your skin would look like the one of these beautiful, beautiful(did I
                  remark beautiful??) models and k-pop singers. It was 2017 and one brand was doing a huge marketing effort and
                  was in almost every k-beauty video: Klairs. And I did something that I had not done in a while: I bought a skin-care 
                  product. Actually, I bought two: the Midnight Blue Calming Cream and the Gentle Black Sugar Facial Polish (did I say 
                  that I had an obsession with exfoliating?). <br>
                Once I tried  the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream), I never looked back. <br>

                 Something about the texture, the price, the quality... Everything was just perfect. After a long and snowy day, this 
                 beautiful-blue cream would calm my tired skin, appearing the brightest it had ever been. 
                 Little by little I incorporated more products to my rutine, getting enthusiastic with the results. It has been 
                 a bit of trial and error, but in general, I have never had major problems with a Korean products. <br>

                 Thats why this blog it is called Korean Original Beauty. Because of the pride they take in their creations, in what 
                 they put out in the market. You can find a great variety of products(cheaper, more expensive, diferent textures,
                 actives, emulsions, ampoules, mists... And dont get me started on  sheet-masks...). But they all have something in commom:
                 the aim to make your skin better, to make your life easier. Korean products have completely changed the skincare and makeup industry. 
                 And they have changed my philosophy about skincare.

              </p>
            <p>**Side note: my dream is to go to Korea to experience the food, the culture and, of course, to buy all the products
                my wallet can handle! **
            </p>

            <p class="currentphilosophy">What is my current philosophy about skincare?</p>

            <p> For me, skincare goes hand-in-hand with a healthy life-style. I don't do it mainly beacuse of the results I get
                (but of course, it is a very good bonus). I do it because of the way it makes me feel. As a person with GAD,
                my skincare comes into the whole package of feeling good, not only about my outer appereance, but having inner peace.
                So I try to eat healthy, I walk in the nature when I have the chance (that and yoga are my current favourite phisical
                 activities) and the most important, sleeping well. 
                 Some people would say that skincare is superficial and unnecesary. But in my case, it is part of my ritual to get 
                 that happiness and state of mind that allows me to live my life with a smile.
