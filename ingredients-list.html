			<p id="a"><b> AHA: </b> Also known as Alfa Hydroxy Acid. It function is to exfoliate the skin by removing dead cells.
				are acids derived from natural substances such as sugar cane, milk, and grapes. <br>
				They work by melting the intercellular glue that holds our skin cells together, to help the skin’s natural shedding process. 
				AHA’s are made up of tiny molecules of water loving and water soluble acids. AHAs are preferred for sun-damaged and dry skin 
				because they exfoliate the skin’s surface and have the added benefit of also improving moisture content.
				No matter which AHA you choose, the strong exfoliating effects make your skin more sensitive to the sun. 
				Wear sunscreen every morning to prevent burns, age spots, and increased skin cancer risks.</p>
			<h6 id="b">B</h6>

			<p><b>BHA: </b> Beta-hydroxy acids, is a oil-soluble exfoliant. It is a nonabrasive acid derived from salicin, a chemical similar in nature to aspirin. 
				Salicin is primarily extracted from willow bark, but may also originate from wintergreen and sweet birch. 
				BHA posses the ability to loosen and break the attachment between cells. This process causes the formation of new cells while exfoliating the
				 epidermis, or outer layer of skin.
				It can get deep into the pores and remove dead skin cells and excess sebum, to couter the formation of comedones. <br>
				 Although BHAs don’t make your skin as sensitive to the sun compared to AHAs,
				 you should still wear sunscreen every single day. 
				 Currently, the BHA most commonly used in cosmetics is salicylic acid. On rare occasions, citric acid is also cited as a BHA in cosmetic formulations.

			<p><b> Dimethicon:</b> or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a synthetic polymer of silicon. According to wikipedia, polymers are  large molecules, 
				or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Due to their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers 
				play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. There's A LOT of debate arround this ingredient and silicons in general.
				 Some claim that it cloges the pores and causes acne, while others love it because it makes products easily spreadable,
				  so you get that feeling of the productgliding over your skin. Dimethicone also helps form a protective barrier on the skin, 
				  and can fill in the fine lines and wrinkles on the face. Also, it is claim that  is effective at l
				  ocking in moisture thanks to its larger molecules. The truth is that Dimethicone and Dimethicone copolyol don't evaporate and stay on the 
				  skin longer and is more prone to cause allergies than other types of silicones. That being said, it depends on the skin type and
				condition. </p>

			<p><b>Ferments:</b> also known as probiotics, refers to skin care products loaded with good bacteria, usually from fermented natural
				 ingredients. Fermentation is a natural proccess when a microorganism (usually a bacteria) is added to an organic material.
				 The bacteria releases enzymes that break down the natural ingredient and changes its molecular structure. Many studies have proved
				that fermented ingredients are more potent as well as more effective for sensitive and dry skin. In the other hand, some people
				can suffer from allergies and worsed skin conditions when using fermented ingredients. </p>

				Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier or defoamer in foods, vitamins, medicines, and vaccines.
