           <h2>Name of the product</h2>
           
          <div class="text">

              Kale-lalu-yAHA
              
              <p> If you are here, you are most likely a Korean cosmetics fan. And if so, I am sure you looove Liah Yoo. 
              This youtuber has the capacity to make her videos scientific based, while making them super fun. 
              When she announced that she was going to have her own cosmetic line it was like… YEEEES. I had to try it, I just trust in her so much, 
              that I knew it was going to be awesome. Even though she only sends to some parts of Asia and USA, the truth is you can buy her products via ebay, 
              roseroseshop.com, or amazon. </p>
              
              <p>At the time I was ready to make my order, she had 4 products on the market (now 5), and I wanted to try them all. 
              But my economy doesn’t allow that. After debating between the Great Barrier Relief and the Kal-lalu-yAHA, this last one was the winner.
               Why? Because I didn’t have any chemical exfoliator after my One Step Original Clear Pad from COSRX was finished. Kale- lalu- yAHA looked
              more powerful than other products out there, like Cosrx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner, the Some By Mi AHA/BHA 30 Miracle Toner, etc… </p>
              
             <p> At first, I was scared. I have sensitive skin, of course I was scared. The ingredients list didn’t look too scary, though: </p>
              
              <p>Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Water, Butylene glycol, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf (Kale) Extract, Glycolic acid (5.25%), 1,2-Hexanediol, 
              Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, 
              Malus Domestica Fruit (Green apple) Extract, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Betaine Salicylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Pseudozyma Epicola/Camellia 
              Sinensis Seed Oil/Glucose/Yeast Extract Ferment Filtrate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Bacillus/Folic acid/Soybean ferment extract, Coptis Japonica Root Extract, 
              Malachite Extract, Polysorbate80, Disodium EDTA. </p>
              
              <p> Ok, so we have the Glycolic Acid which acts as the exfoliator per se, then we have antioxidants, Hyaluronic Acid (who doesn’t love it?) and soothing ingredients 
              like aloe or allantoin.  </p>
             
              <h4 class="startDescribe">Now, the product:</h4>
              
             <p>It has a beautiful light-green color. The scent is a bit strong but bearable, I would describe it as chemically. The texture, watery. 
              In my skin routine, I use it after double cleansing, when I am out of the shower. I will soak a cotton pad with the product and slide it through my face 
              (like we use to do with the toners before the patting came into our lifes). BUT, if my skin needs a reset (like Krave’s own statement) 
              and is feeling clogged, I will soak 3 cotton pads and leave them in my face for a minute or so, so me skin really absorbs everything. </p>
              
             <p>The first time I used it, I was careful. I put a small amount in my face and pat it. Afterward, I only used essence and moisturizing.  
              I have to say that after I applied it, I felt a bit of tingling, however, it went after I put my essence on(phewwwww!).
               Everything went well without any drama, which exactly what I am looking for. </p>
              
              <p> But the next morning… I could not believe it. My skin looked so fresh, so clear. I don’t normally believe in products that claims they 
              work from the very first used. But I saw a result, it was right there, looking at me at 7 a.m. with puffy eyes and a surprised face. 
              It didn’t get rid of all my whiteheads (actually, of any them) and my forehead wrinkle was still there. But my skin was brightening. </p>
              
             <p>In 3/4 weeks you can see improves in your skin texture, this is slower, but it works surely. The only time I had problems with irritation
               with this product was when I tried to use more frequently. I discovered that my skin is too sensitive for more than once a week usage(I should have known,
                but anyway I had to try it). I didn’t have a huge reaction, but instead of being better, the next morning my face was a little bit reddish. </p>
              
             <p> After two months using it, I can confidentially recommend this product if you are looking for an easy to use and effective chemical exfoliator. </p>
